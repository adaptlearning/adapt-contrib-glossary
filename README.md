This extension allows for a list of glossary terms to be displayed (in alphabetical order) in the 'drawer' of the course. The terms can be clicked to reveal a definition. The list of terms is searchable.

## Installation

First, be sure to install the [Adapt Command Line Interface](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt-cli), then from the command line run:-

        adapt install adapt-contrib-glossary

This extension can also be installed by adding the extension to the adapt.json file before running `adapt install`:
 
        "adapt-contrib-glossary": "*"
## Usage
You can create links to items in the glossary in the format `<a href='#' data-glossaryterm='About Framework'>Adapt Framework</a>`. You should avoid doing this in text that will be displayed within a Notify popup (e.g. question feedback) as the Glossary will open behind the Notify popup.
